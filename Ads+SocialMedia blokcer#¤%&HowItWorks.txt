Blocking ads via the **hosts file** is a straightforward and effective method to prevent your computer from connecting to known ad servers by redirecting their domain names to a non-routable IP address, usually **0.0.0.0** or **127.0.0.1**. This essentially stops your system from loading ad content before your browser even requests it.

### How It Works
- The hosts file acts as a local DNS override. When your browser tries to load an ad from a domain like `ad.doubleclick.net`, the hosts file redirects the request to your local machine (0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1), which serves no ad content, effectively blocking the ad.
- This method can block ads **across the entire operating system**, including browsers and apps that access the internet, not just in one browser[3][5].

### Steps to Block Ads via Hosts File
1. Locate your hosts file:
   - **Windows:** `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
   - **Linux and macOS:** `/etc/hosts`
2. Open the hosts file with a text editor **as administrator/root**.
3. Add entries for ad servers you want to block, each starting with `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1` followed by the domain. For example:
   ```
   0.0.0.0 ad.doubleclick.net
   0.0.0.0 ads.google.com
   ```
4. Save the file and restart your browser (or machine) for the changes to take effect.

### Where to Get Ad Domains Lists
- You can manually add popular or troublesome ad-serving domains.
- Alternatively, use curated and regularly updated hosts files from trusted sources:
  - **Steven Black’s hosts list**: Combines multiple blocklists into one maintained hosts file.
  - **SomeoneWhocares.org**
  - **MVPS hosts file**
  - **Yoyo.org ad servers list**[2][3][8]  
These lists cover thousands of known ad, tracking, malware, and phishing domains, allowing you to block the majority of ads without manual updating.

### Pros and Cons of Hosts File Blocking

| Pros                                         | Cons                                                |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Blocks ads system-wide, not just in browsers | Requires manual editing with admin rights           |
| Very low resource usage (no memory impact)   | Can only block entire domains, not page elements    |
| Enhances privacy by blocking trackers too    | Less granular control; can’t whitelist easily        |
| Does not rely on browser extensions           | Updates to blocklists are manual or semi-automated   |

### Summary
Blocking ads using the hosts file offers an effective, lightweight, and OS-level approach to ad blocking without needing browser extensions. It requires editing system files and using curated hosts lists of ad servers to achieve the best results. To maintain effective blocking, periodically update your hosts file with the latest lists from reputable sources.

This method is especially useful if you want system-wide ad blocking or if you want to prevent users from disabling ad blocking easily since the hosts file is managed by the OS[1][2][3][5].
